### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Exploration using Pandas library

### Description
This program enables users explore bikeshare data from three US cities - Washington, New York City and Chicago.

The program takes user's input for the city name, month and day for which the user wants to view data. There's an option to select 'all' instead of specifiying month and day to skip the filter.

Following user input, the user gets presented with the following data -

Most popular month
Most popular day
Most popular hour
Most popular start station
Most popular end station
Most popular combination of start and end stations
Total trip duration
Average trip duration
Types of users by number
Types of users by gender (if available)
The oldest user's birth year (if available)
The youngest user's birth year (if available)
The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

The user is prompted with the choice of displaying the raw data 5 lines at a time, and finally given a choice to restart the program.
